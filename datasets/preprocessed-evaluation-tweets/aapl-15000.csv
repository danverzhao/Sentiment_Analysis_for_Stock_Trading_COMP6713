"$MSFT $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL A lot of people don&39;t realize that stocks aren&39;t actually stocks in the traditional sense of equities being &quot;at risk&quot; anymore. We&39;re in a world where the FED&39;s mandates prevent them from doing much of anything but print a ton of money. When the stock market is everyone&39;s 401k and wealth, saving the economy actually means saving the stock market. It&39;s a tough pill for many to swallow because the jobless claims are rising and by any measure stocks &quot;should&quot; be going down, but they aren&39;t, and it&39;s because the FED has essentially turned them into variable rate treasuries. Pretty soon they&39;ll outright support stock prices by directly buying equities, very soon. Then you&39;ll witness the meltup of a lifetime as the poorest 90% of our country get absolutely devastated and the richest 10% get so much richer it&39;ll be bonkers. I&39;m planning to get my fair share of the trillions getting printed. &quot;Trade the market that&39;s in front of you, not the one you think it should be&quot;.",2020-07-19T07:32:10Z,1340663,229005999

$AAPL On daily chart MACD has crossed down and $AAPL has been in an uptrend for quite long time. We have been away from the 21sma test as well. $AAPL weekly chart above shows a doji (red) candle in place so for bullish move we need post $401 to make new highs. The 50% weekly retracement from low to the highs is around $307 and is too far away for now. I am leaning more to bearish side on $AAPL because of the run it had so far and I would be using $380 as the trigger for adding some puts for first test of the 21sma after a long time around the $371 area. I would be looking at 07/24 $375 puts only if we get the trigger on below the $380 area till then no trigger no trade. Weekly chart also shows we are far away from the 10 weekly avg of $345 and seems extended here due to the parabolic run it had from $212 March lows to $401. I am not taking any long trades on $AAPL here though unless $401 is cleared on the higher end and this bull run continues.,2020-07-18T16:46:24Z,1849877,228887076

Because we have a gazillion vaccines coming (EU would be bigger catalyst). The X factor? Our stimulus plan. Does it get renewed. If so, do politicians rock the mkt a bit leading up to it.

"It is tempting to comment on so many posts that I see on this platform but I resist 99.9% or the time. A few golden rules of investing or trading:1. Never bet more in a single stock than you can afford to lose2. If you cannot afford to lose money, don&39;t.  Buy an index $AAPL or $AMZN and call it a day. Check back once a month not every 10 minutes. 3. Understand the differende between trading and investing. Are you a trader or investor? Or both? Many in $NNDM and $HOFV think they are day trading stock like the fluff on RH. They are not. 4. Have clear entry points and exits for all your trades, use stop losses as needed to limit downside and bag holding.traders I&39;m looking at you.5. Do your own research and due diligence, don&39;t rely on strangers, myself included to provide you trading advice 6. Understand the emotional toll of trading - I used to work on Wall St as a trader and I can assure you it was stressful. TRADING IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.",2020-07-16T17:30:12Z,3631474,228355920

"$TSLA  :fire:  :shorts:  :fire: I mistakenly criticized Dan Ive&39;s call initially . one thing he mentions multiple times was the heavy reliance on China for his price target . For him, Tesla is all about China . Of course, the Chinese auto market is the largest in the world and that&39;s why he&39;s giving a heavy waiting to Tesla&39;s Giga Shanghai Factory . which has actually begun contributing to Tesla&39;s vehicle delivery numbers and the revenue . And so that&39;s really great considering that the factory was built in under a year, which was last year . And this year it&39;s expected to do potentially over a 100,000 vehicles in its first year of operations which is really big considering Tesla did 367,000 vehicles in total last year without China helping them . $MSFT, $AAPL, $NFLX, $COST,",2020-07-15T20:30:14Z,3320592,228102103

Martin further cites Apple being on the &quot;right side&quot; of privacy regulators and notes that the company&39;s &quot;strong&quot; balance sheet, free cash flows, and share buybacks moderate investor risks.

"$SPY $UVXY $TSLA $AAPL $BA My thoughts on today  . it would be disingenuous of me not to point out what I got wrong today, so let&39;s start with that. Given yesterday&39;s sharp reversal in tech, I was pretty certain we would see continuation to the downside. And we certainly were trading that way most of the day. But then we got some Fed speak that juiced us into the close and after hrs, MRNA released some more news to help give investors confidence. And once again we will be knocking on that 3230 resistance. Was MRNA news leaked today? Most likely . hence the ramp into close and huge buy on close imbalances. Be that as it may, its part of the game. I still stick to my comments that the Nasdaq topped, but what i mentioned yesterday, that Nasdaq money will get redistributed - well, thats going to happen tomorrow most likely. All the dead money stocks - casinos, airlines, cruise ships, BA, etc. - they wil catch a bid. Now we shall see if 3230 is breached.",2020-07-14T21:25:12Z,162218,227776036

Then once enough people are on the train and they’ve made their millions, they pull out the rug. It’s honestly sick considering the rich truly just get much richer while the common folk like most of us are just trying to make enough to live a life where they don’t have to worry about bills, and also be able to do what they want in life without despising their jobs/careers and being miserable.

The analyst is seeing a &quot;continued demand snapback&quot; in China and believes the stage is setting up for a &quot;massive pent up&quot; iPhone 12 cycle heading into the fall. He estimates roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from China over the coming year. Between 60M to 70M iPhones are in the window of an upgrade opportunity over the next year, says Ives, who has increasing confidence in the iPhone 12 growth story following channel checks in Asia.

Well, it&39;s quite simple. The mkt is way overbought given the status of the world we live in. So for me to go long say, SHOP at $1030 ,trading 60 times next year&39;s revenues, and overbought technically, that doesn&39;t offer me much of a risk/reward benefit. With that said, I&39;m very aware of the euphoria and how long it can last. And I&39;m aware that a break above 3230 and you can probably pencil in new highs. But I&39;d much rather play this mkt on the short side. Like with FSLY. Or better yet, like I&39;ve been doing with airlines, cruise ships and BA (All three may give you another nice setup Mon or Tues to get short again). Earnings begin this week. Bulls need financials to perform (im very skeptical they do) this week if they want 3230 taken out. Im slow skeptical these tech names like NFLX go higher after they report.

My question is, how can I equally divide the $200.00 over the 10 stocks? Do I buy a few whole shares every $200.00 deposit? Do I contribute $20.00 equally amounts the 10 shares every deposit? Do I use the first $200.00 of the month to invest in 3 stocks and the next $200.00 to invest in another 3 stocks and the last $200.00 for the remaining 4 stocks?

@OldFngGuy $SPY $AAPL And yes I truly believe demand for IPhones will drop. As a tech nerd I know what I’m talking about in that aspect. They only thing I could see them do with the new iPhone is have screens with higher refresh rates like the iPad Pro’s and upgrading the screens to 4K displays. Actually I would finally upgrade if they did do that. But other than that there is no where else to go (unless there is a breakthrough). As you can see Android is fiddling with foldable shit that nobody wants. So we are talking about faster phones by a small percentage with slightly upgraded screens. Yeah demand will fade if that becomes the status quo. And that’s for all of tech. Why should I upgrade from my 2080TI to a 3000 series Nividia GPU when I can run every game 4K max settings? Or why would I upgrade my 4K TV if there isn’t any shows in 8k? There will be a fade in demand which will lead to a new breakthrough.,2020-07-09T10:34:05Z,3043827,226377574

Apple&39;s gross margins have been decreasing and net income has remained flat for more than 5yrs while people look the other way. I can see no reason to justify the existing share price when even in the best of times their net income was flat. P/E has expanded from 14 to 29 during the period of no income growth.

The practice has been anecdotally popular, however, little research has been conducted to rigorously test how useful these imperceptible doses of psychedelic drugs actually can be.”iuse watchthis maxcreative investing usa thc vaping greenlaneholdings gnln Join my Weed Education group on FB! “Weed.ed” getweeded [URL]",2020-07-08T14:15:16Z,2909088,226128376

This should happen after they invaded Taiwan. They appear very confident that they can  hold onto Taiwan and keep America away,  just like the Imperial Japanese in 1942. The CCP has also announced today the extinguishing of national medical coverage, leaving it to the people to pay for their own medicine.  And this is a socialist state!

Its $2 billion of three-year debt, within the Fed’s maturity range, priced to yield less than 0.85%.Still, Apple openly using debt sales to help finance share repurchases puts the Fed in a somewhat awkward position. Chair Jerome Powell has consistently framed questions about its secondary-market facility in the context of supporting the central bank’s full employment mandate.

Wait for the economy to go to shit and then all the sudden wanna throw out 2 quarters in price shit in a year and a half down the road. No reason Apple shouldn’t had a $400 price target before the collapse. anything to manipulate the price higher,2020-07-07T21:29:23Z,447314,225982303

"$SPY $UVXY $BA $TSLA $AAPL My thoughts on today. this morning in pre-mkt I was shorting BA and I warned investors that it&39;s going lower, as is other travel/leisure companies (was short RCL as well). And as I pointed out yesterday, the Nasdaq is getting very close to a blowoff top. So why the bearish calls today? Two reasons 1) anyone see the VIX yesterday. Up on a big up mkt day. That signals positioning into protection. 2) more importantly, many of you probably remember talking a lot about bond yields. Anyone notice them today? I follow the 10 yr and as I noted last week, a break below .60 and I think this mkt gets spooked. We are getting dangerously close at .63. On a more technical level, the mkt tried to retest that 3220 level. And although we are going to be choppy, use today&39;s mkt highs as your tradable top. For me, I continue to find weak companies like BA and RCL to short on pops. Yes, im still skeptical of this mkt. But I will climb along for any ride if we break 3220  :victory_hand: ",2020-07-07T20:12:53Z,162218,225959486

Still think it is risky b/c who knows, maybe market down bigly tonight and Disney may pullback tomorrow (like it did last night/this morning).  :man_shrugging: I&39;m liking what i&39;m seeing though on the charts - Disney MACD coiling back up, RSI indicating not overbought.  Also, there&39;s only so much money to shift around, no one is jumping in.  Predicting that the Apple money, the microsoft money, the facebook money, the Chase money is now selling off/going to shift into Disney by end of week.Make no mistake the House of the Mouse will be the stock of Thursday and Friday.  How can it not after Disney has consolidated and hasn&39;t had it&39;s run up yet?  GL.",2020-07-07T17:30:06Z,1420408,225901973

That&39;s net NEGATIVE liquidity.after record levels of net positive liquidity.Simply put, the FED is NO LONGER covering the 200 billion/wk that the treasury is issuing.

"After almost 10 years of following and investing in the market, my overwhelming conclusion is: most or all of these bashers and scammers who speak negatively (and don’t issue a disclaimer that they’re only giving short term opinions) are really just trying to rob you of your confidence and prevent you - if they can - from buying and holding excellent businesses for the long term.

Despite the situation, Apple is now less likely to face a worst-case scenario of postponing the launch until 2021 - the situation it was in three months ago - as suppliers work overtime to make up for lost time.  The tech giant has also asked suppliers to build more than 45M older models for the second half of 2020, in a move to shield the company in case of any delays to the 5G iPhones.",2020-07-01T13:23:54Z,1890535,224517416

"$SPY $BA $UVXY $AAPL $TSLA My thoughts this morning  . yesterday, when mkts were surging I recommended you start to build short positions (SEE BELOW). The reason? The mkt was at the top end of my trading range of 3100, a level I think holds. Also,  the news just keep ls getting worse. And in typical fashion, the mkt pumped into qtr end and once again trapped a lot of bulls. Now, we have some economic data coming up next two days. But im expecting bad news not good. The key today is two things- 1) does the mkt make an inside/outside move. Meaning, do we take out yesterday&39;s entire gains and close on the lows. Secondly, and more importantly, watch the growth stocks. SHOP, ZM, FSLY, TWLO, AAPL, etc. Why? If those go against their daily pattern - uo when mkt sells off, reversing this &quot;pour money into the high growth/stay at home stocks&quot;, well, you can pencil in 2950 retest and all of a sudden 2800 will start being discussed.

However, the mkt jumped and late day caught wind of  huge buy on mkt close orders which brought us right to the level I said would be our resistance - 3100. Earlier in the day I mentioned you will probably want to start building short positions above 307, preferably if we pump over 308. I did so because I thought the end of day pump had already occurred - I didn&39;t see that 20 handle move coming. Regardless, now what? Well, I stick to my sell thesis up at this level until we can close above 3100. Anyone see bond yields? I&39;m watching that 10yr like a hawk. If it cracks .60 we are heading to 2800. Gold? If everything is all clear, why is gold trading at 8 yr highs? Yeah, history says the next two days are very bullish heading into the 4th of July weekend. However, history never include Covid-19.

"$SPY $UVXY $BA $FB $AAPL My thoughts on today . over the weekend I continued my pessimistic outlook for the mkt, suggesting it would retest 2950 before having a bounce. And if things deteriorated further, 2800 was not out of the question. This morning we touched 2980 and the mkt deemed that worthy enough to bounce. I sensed this would probably occur, hence my recommendation of buying FB in pre-mkt at $207 (SEE BELOW) for a trade today. So where does that leave us? BA really dragged this mkt higher, as well as dragging the beaten up sectors like airlines, casinos and cruise ships. But I&39;m not buying that BA bounce. Don&39;t get me wrong, BA closed strong. But who is going to buy these new planes if certification goes as they plan. Id be more of a seller of BA after that huge runup. And as I&39;ve stated all last week, 3100 to me is sort of the ceiling on this overall trading range.

In recent weeks, investors have started to hedge the tech sector, a notable shift because many investors generally just buy bullish calls, or sell bearish puts, to profit off the sector and many of the hot stocks, the author notes. The rise in hedging suggests a sharper decline may be in the future for hot tech stocks, including the fabled FAANGs, which include Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Netflix (NFLX), Sears contends.

"$SPY $UVXY $BA $AAPL $FB My thoughts on today and heading into Monday . last weekend I gave the gameplan for this week - simply, the bears were going to win the week (SEE BELOW). My thesis was simple - the mkt would no longer ignore the bad news and all the jawboning out of the administration would finally fall on deaf ears. I also pointed to the end of qtr rebalancing and how professionals will try to get out in front of it because there may be some big selling. My call was for a test of 2950 but they sure did defend 3,000 and held the 200 day.  Congrats if you took advantage. So now what? Well, everything I use to determine direction tells me not only is 2950 in play, but 2800 is also a possibility. And I am short heading into Monday. So why am I still weary? Because it almost looks too obvious. And I KNOW some serious jawboning, vaccine news, trade deal progress, etc. will hit Sunday night if we are deep red.  I&39;m just counting on the mkt making sense. Like it did all week.  :victory_hand: ",2020-06-27T01:49:23Z,162218,223436444

@Tub66516 @ThorTheCat @gs80 @jonmogul @Baldwick I trade for a living I know what a reverse split is.

So anything you see on the chart prior to may is actually that price divided by 12 and you would get the actual price that it was trading at that time. This formula is not accounting for other splits that might have occurred. In VHI that is the only split history I found. Now we can continue to dispute this but I assure you I&39;m not just making this shit up.

$AAPL do you remember less than two years ago when Apple was crucified because they didn’t report iPhone sales? They were getting pissed at all the analysts that only focused on that one segment of their industry. They were explaining that they were evolving into much bigger things. But the analysts couldn’t handle it. They couldn’t figure out how to model a projection on Apple outside just phone sales. (Enter in the stupidity of the analyst). I wish I had recording UNH on CNBC saying sell. They won’t give us numbers. They were the smartest people on the street to handle Wall Street. Stop thinking of us as a phone company because we are not. And then. here we are today.,2020-06-25T23:21:01Z,1546183,223038967

"$SPY $UVXY $BA $AAPL My thoughts on today. oh what a difference a day makes. More bad news, different results. But hey, you can&39;t deny the rally into the close. Even the crap tried to rally - casinos, airlines and cruise ships. Albeit after several painful days. The mkt has left us in a pretty tight trading range and it&39;s clear until it breaks (2950-3200). What breaks it to thd downside? All the things I&39;ve already listed can and should make the mkt break. What breaks it to the upside? A vaccine. Yes, I think we are absolutely capped at that 3200 top until a vaccine or some extremely positive news on Covid-19. And that&39;s why I lean more pessimistic when we are at that 3100 level because our ceiling is somewhat capped imo. So now what? The way the mkt closed on such a big rally would leave you to bet the mkt gaps up tomorrow. But I&39;m not going to bite. For one, I think there are too many red flags. But also, I still see further downside. I&39;m more inclined to own a little UVXY. Gutsy.",2020-06-25T22:54:37Z,162218,223031915
