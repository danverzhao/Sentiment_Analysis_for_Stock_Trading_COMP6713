A lot of people don&#39;t realize that stocks aren&#39;t actually stocks in the traditional sense of equities being &quot;at risk&quot; anymore. We&#39;re in a world where the FED&#39;s mandates prevent them from doing much of anything but print a ton of money. When the stock market is everyone&#39;s 401k and wealth, saving the economy actually means saving the stock market. It&#39;s a tough pill for many to swallow because the jobless claims are rising and by any measure stocks &quot;should&quot; be going down, but they aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s because the FED has essentially turned them into variable rate treasuries. Pretty soon they&#39;ll outright support stock prices by directly buying equities, very soon. Then you&#39;ll witness the meltup of a lifetime as the poorest 90% of our country get absolutely devastated and the richest 10% get so much richer it&#39;ll be bonkers. I&#39;m planning to get my fair share of the trillions getting printed. &quot;Trade the market that&#39;s in front of you, not the one you think it should be&quot;.",2020-07-19T07:32:10Z,1340663,229005999

üëâ Jeremy, one of the biggest Tesla Pumpers said, &quot;If you&#39;re buying the stock at $1500, you better be confident in 3 things&quot;. 
Now only 2.5% of world car sales are EV vehicles.

1. &quot;All cars sold in 10 years will be EVs&quot;.
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  In Asia or other side countries, more than 95% of homes don&#39;t have the concept of garage to charge at night.

2. &quot;Tesla should be No.1 or 2 player &amp; dominant market share in US &amp; EU &amp; China: 25-50% market share.&quot;
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  There are still consumer preference &amp; brand royalty over BMW, Audi, Mercedez, Toyota, AND strong demands for affordable EVs in Asia and other continents. 

3.  &quot;Tesla should be No.1 or No.2 autonomous player in Long term&quot;
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  People are already locked in iOS and Android(device, car, IoT). They&#39;re already working on it. What makes you think Tesla win against tech giants?

AAPL,$AAPL On daily chart MACD has crossed down and $AAPL has been in an uptrend for quite long time. We have been away from the 21sma test as well. $AAPL weekly chart above shows a doji (red) candle in place so for bullish move we need post $401 to make new highs. The 50% weekly retracement from low to the highs is around $307 and is too far away for now. I am leaning more to bearish side on $AAPL because of the run it had so far and I would be using $380 as the trigger for adding some puts for first test of the 21sma after a long time around the $371 area. I would be looking at 07/24 $375 puts only if we get the trigger on below the $380 area till then no trigger no trade. Weekly chart also shows we are far away from the 10 weekly avg of $345 and seems extended here due to the parabolic run it had from $212 March lows to $401.

For the recent week, the stock market has been pretty flat and I am unable to have any meaningfully conclusion of the next market direction yet. Pending next week price action, I am still maintaining my Bearish view here. However, I will say that the longer the market stay at the current level, it will be more Bullish for the stock market. Therefore, it will be very important to see the market move down from the current level soon to maintain my Bearish view. 

I will share more in my full Tide Indicators analysis on 20 July 2020.",2020-07-18T15:32:22Z,3755420,228877985

Psychological Traps Investors Should Avoid

üëâ Irrational Exuberance by Overconfidence Bias.

When enough investors are overconfident, we have the conditions of Greenspan&#39;s famous, &quot;irrational exuberance,&quot; where investor overconfidence pumps the market up to the point where a huge correction is inevitable.3Ôªø The investors who get hit the hardest ‚Äî the ones who are still all-in just before the correction ‚Äî are the overconfident ones who are sure that the bull run will last forever. Trusting that a bull won&#39;t turn on you is a sure way to get yourself gored.

This is why Masks do not work.
Average temperature in a air conditioned office or home is normally 74 to 76 degrees.
  The COVID-19 Virus will last at least a half a day on normal surfaces . 
 Surfaces like door handle going into a building.
 Chairs and credit card machines people touch with their infected hands RIGHT after they put on their infected mask before entry of any building 
  This works out great stopping the spread of the Virus 
      when you have people breathing and coughing into their stylish everyday cloth  Mask made at home or bought on Amazon.
 The Virus is point one (.10) microns in diameter a N95 Mask can filter the virus fairly well.
 A normal mask is just a joke.

Does the Fed have your back? Are they all powerful? Maybe you didn‚Äôt know they once  went bankrupt!

‚ÄúMr. Chairman, we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, hereinafter called the Fed. The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation&#39;s debt. The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over.

&quot;This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of these United States, has bankrupted itself, and has practically bankrupted our Government. It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates, through the maladministration of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it.‚Äù

And in almost all other scenarios, this should have been a down week given, I don&#39;t know, the pandemic and tech selloff. So what happened? More like, what&#39;s about to happen. The mkt was frontrunnimg three events - EU stimulus negotiations over the weekend, AZN vaccine news on Monday, and our own stimulus renewal at the end of the month. What is the likely outcome? I have a feeling EU negotiations hit a snag, so I will take that out of the equation (of course if futures up 30 handles off a deal I will need help removing my foot). The AZN news is fluffy. Why? Because we have a gazillion vaccines coming (EU would be bigger catalyst). The X factor? Our stimulus plan. Does it get renewed. If so, do politicians rock the mkt a bit leading up to it.

unlike Nikola at least, Workhorse is set to sell 300 to 400 of its vans this year. The company is beyond building a conceptual prototype or two. 

Rubber would be meeting road, right? And WKHS does have a pending order to build a total of 1,100 vans for UPS (NYSE:UPS) and DHL
Workhorse‚Äôs HorseFly delivery drone business is another area which puts the company in strong position within the increasingly important trend of ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù delivery service. There‚Äôs also its 10% stake and partnership with privately-held Lordstown Motors (LMC).

Yesterday i had called for a print range 27-31, but really didn&#39;t expect this little hedging, thus i was expecting VIX to print ~30 or certainly higher than 29 but it didnt hah. Not sure what to make of that but i guess everyone reduced risk yesterday as well!

We did see a good amount of rotation out of tech yesterday into other industries like travel, leisure and energy, so we&#39;ll see what happens tomorrow.

1. Never bet more in a single stock than you can afford to lose
2. If you cannot afford to lose money, don&#39;t.  Buy an index $AAPL or $AMZN and call it a day. Check back once a month not every 10 minutes. 
3. Understand the differende between trading and investing. Are you a trader or investor? Or both? Many in $NNDM and $HOFV think they are day trading stock like the fluff on RH. They are not. 
4. Have clear entry points and exits for all your trades, use stop losses as needed to limit downside and bag holding...traders I&#39;m looking at you.
5. Do your own research and due diligence, don&#39;t rely on strangers, myself included to provide you trading advice 
6. Understand the emotional toll of trading - I used to work on Wall St as a trader and I can assure you it was stressful. TRADING IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.",2020-07-16T17:30:12Z,3631474,228355920

NEWS: THESE AIRLINES WILL FLY BOEING‚ÄôS NEWEST AIRCRAFT
July 14, 2020

Boeing‚Äôs newest aircraft type, the B777X is expected in 2021.

November 2013 the Boeing Company announced the Boeing 777X program but developing a new type of aircraft takes years.
Boeing‚Äôs newest aircraft is special because it has Folding Wings. It is the largest wide body two aisle aircraft to fly. With new engines and new wings. The latter is definitely something to highlight, as the wingtip can be folded!
 
Bigger wings give the 777 better aerodynamics. But being able to fold them preserves gate compatibility. The Airbus A380 cannot use regular gates. It needs unique accommodations.
Lufthansa is the 777 launch customer.
Also:
All Nippon Airlines
British Airways
Cathay Pacific
Emirates
Etihad Airways
Lufthansa
Qatar Airways
Singapore Airlines

Poor bears. We didn&#39;t get the sub 27 VIX that i had hoped for, but today was another big day nonetheless (hopefully for everybody). Today we added +25% NAV to the trading account since inception on 6/1.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn&#39;t any bullshit.

Apple price target raised to $450 from $350 at Needham 

Needham analyst Laura Martin raised the firm&#39;s price target on Apple to $450 from $350 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company&#39;s upside is driven by its Services and Wearables business that is expanding its ecosystem while adding to revenue per user, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Martin further cites Apple being on the &quot;right side&quot; of privacy regulators and notes that the company&#39;s &quot;strong&quot; balance sheet, free cash flows, and share buybacks moderate investor risks. The analyst also points to Apple&#39;s efforts to reduce churn by locking in users to stay in the ecosystem through its brand-extension&quot; categories.

Eye-popping gains of around 1,200%, Workhorse‚Äôs valuation of just over $1.50 billion is a fraction of the other mentioned companies in this space.

unlike Nikola at least, Workhorse is set to sell 300 to 400 of its vans this year. The company is beyond building a conceptual prototype or two. 

Rubber would be meeting road, right? And WKHS does have a pending order to build a total of 1,100 vans for UPS (NYSE:UPS) and DHL
Workhorse‚Äôs HorseFly delivery drone business is another area which puts the company in strong position within the increasingly important trend of ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù delivery service. There‚Äôs also its 10% stake and partnership with privately-held Lordstown Motors (LMC).
 
Workhorse is in position to receive royalties on the first 200,000 vehicles sold.

Given yesterday&#39;s sharp reversal in tech, I was pretty certain we would see continuation to the downside. And we certainly were trading that way most of the day. But then we got some Fed speak that juiced us into the close and after hrs, MRNA released some more news to help give investors confidence. And once again we will be knocking on that 3230 resistance. Was MRNA news leaked today? Most likely ... hence the ramp into close and huge buy on close imbalances. Be that as it may, its part of the game. I still stick to my comments that the Nasdaq topped, but what i mentioned yesterday, that Nasdaq money will get redistributed - well, thats going to happen tomorrow most likely. All the dead money stocks - casinos, airlines, cruise ships, BA, etc. - they wil catch a bid. Now we shall see if 3230 is breached.",2020-07-14T21:25:12Z,162218,227776036

Top Federal Reserve Officials Are Starting To Brace For A Prolonged Recession

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said during a webinar this week that economic activity appears to be &quot;leveling off at a level lower than we were pre-crisis, which might suggest there is going to be some loss or that the time required to recover might be quite a bit longer than we might have otherwise expected.‚Äù

They moved their deadline for a decision from July 20th to Aug. 4th, which I take as a positive response.  Otherwise, why not just block it now? They have no reason to block it as $AAPL has 29% of the wearables market whereas $FIT has 3% and trails 3 other companies in market share.   Other figures say Apple has 48% of the watch market and Fitbit is 3rd at 11% behind Samsung.  If they block it, as I&#39;ve said before, they would have to force Apple to divest their watch.  NOT happening IMO.  Apple needs a strong competitor to keep pressure on prices.   Ergo, the deal should be approved.

The US government budget deficit so far this year is $2.7 TRILLION (vs ~$750 billion at this point last year).

U.S. budget deficit hits all-time high of $864 BILLION IN JUNE.

This year&#39;s budget deficit is on track to be the worst since WWII (as % of GDP). 

Fighting this pandemic is akin to fighting a war, many economists have said.

These numbers are what you would call a government out of control. Inflation comes from too much printing of money &amp; too much gov&#39;t spending.

This week, the fund flow on Crude oil flipped back to Long again after switching to Short for a short week on 7 July 2020. The indecisiveness in the fund flow of Crude Oil suggests that there is no confirmation of any reversal back to Bullish on the fund flow of the stock market yet currently.

As my Tide Indicators remain Bearish on the stock market, I am still expecting the 3 Key charts to trend down towards the bottom of the consolidation range for the upcoming week.

For the remaining of July, my expectations of the 3 Key charts are still a breakdown towards the bottom of the consolidation range. And this bearish breakdown is likely to signal the start of the next major bearish tide downwards movement probably during August.

During 2021 Apple will be the first company valued at $2 trillion given its &quot;5G tailwinds and services momentum potential over the coming years,&quot; Ives tells investors in a research note. The analyst is seeing a &quot;continued demand snapback&quot; in China and believes the stage is setting up for a &quot;massive pent up&quot; iPhone 12 cycle heading into the fall. He estimates roughly 20% of iPhone upgrades will be coming from China over the coming year. Between 60M to 70M iPhones are in the window of an upgrade opportunity over the next year, says Ives, who has increasing confidence in the iPhone 12 growth story following channel checks in Asia. Apple is the analyst&#39;s favorite name to play the 5G theme and he &quot;strongly&quot; believes a &quot;further re-rating of Apple&#39;s stock is on the horizon.&quot;

Well, it&#39;s quite simple. The mkt is way overbought given the status of the world we live in. So for me to go long say, SHOP at $1030 ,trading 60 times next year&#39;s revenues, and overbought technically, that doesn&#39;t offer me much of a risk/reward benefit. With that said, I&#39;m very aware of the euphoria and how long it can last. And I&#39;m aware that a break above 3230 and you can probably pencil in new highs. But I&#39;d much rather play this mkt on the short side. Like with FSLY. Or better yet, like I&#39;ve been doing with airlines, cruise ships and BA (All three may give you another nice setup Mon or Tues to get short again). Earnings begin this week. Bulls need financials to perform (im very skeptical they do) this week if they want 3230 taken out. Im slow skeptical these tech names like NFLX go higher after they report.

&quot;We think diffractive optics holds the key to AR, but writing millions of tiny optic structures is best done photographically, using nano self-assembly, not expensive precision etching like HoloLens. We need to break the manufacturing price barrier,‚Äù said Dr. G. Chen, CTO at Foxconn. ‚ÄúWith DigiLens waveguide diffractive optics, they seem to have overcome most nagging technical problems and we see a very bright future for them.‚Äù

Not only that, but Digilens sources Microvision&#39;s particular Laser Beam Scanning patent quite frequently, where Microvision describes the interaction between laser beam scanner and waveguides.

Just a thought. Could the mega caps outperforming the rest of the market so much be caused by the introduction of Fractional Shares?

I know when I first got access to fractional shares the first stock I bought was Amazon. Prior to that I figured it would be many l, many years until I wanted to afford the big boys.

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy hinted at tax increases for next fiscal year, saying the state will need ‚ÄúREVENUE RAISERS&quot; to balance the budget and recover from the pandemic.

The $7.6 billion stopgap budget Murphy enacted through Sept. 30 contained no new taxes. That won‚Äôt be the case for the fiscal 2021 budget, which is due to lawmakers on Aug. 25, he said Thursday during an interview with Bloomberg Television.

They only thing I could see them do with the new iPhone is have screens with higher refresh rates like the iPad Pro‚Äôs and upgrading the screens to 4K displays. Actually I would finally upgrade if they did do that. But other than that there is no where else to go (unless there is a breakthrough). As you can see Android is fiddling with foldable shit that nobody wants. So we are talking about faster phones by a small percentage with slightly upgraded screens. Yeah demand will fade if that becomes the status quo. And that‚Äôs for all of tech. Why should I upgrade from my 2080TI to a 3000 series Nividia GPU when I can run every game 4K max settings? Or why would I upgrade my 4K TV if there isn‚Äôt any shows in 8k? There will be a fade in demand which will lead to a new breakthrough.,2020-07-09T10:34:05Z,3043827,226377574

Buy Apple Stock Before It Reaches Inevitable $2 Trillion Valuation. 

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/buy-aapl-stock-before-it-reaches-inevitable-2-trillion-valuation-1029377129

Two years ago, Apple became the first company to hit a $1 trillion valuation. Other tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) soon joined the club, but Apple was the first. With a market capitalization of over $1.6 trillion at this point, and a massive product launch coming this fall, a $2 trillion Apple is within sight.

Apple Moving Toward a $2 Trillion Valuation.

Analysts have been increasingly vocal about the inevitability of AAPL stock hitting that $2 trillion valuation. 

In January, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote: ‚ÄúWe believe by the end of 2021 Apple has potential to be the first $2 trillion valuation given the 5G tailwinds and services momentum potential over the coming years.‚Äù

Apple‚Äôs stock needs to hit $461.89 to reach the $2 trillion market capitalization. Currently trading at over $376, that means a gain of roughly 23% in share price will do it.",2020-07-09T02:49:00Z,3084945,226348992

3. It‚Äôs APPLE... how long have people like Buffet and other top investors been sayin this is the best run company in the world?

So until the FED pulls a 2018 again this stock will not drop below 365 but once the FED does finally attempt to pull back we will be back at 180 faster than anyone will be able to sell anything

While profit expectations have worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs price-earnings ratio to a 20-year high, equities look cheap relative to bonds amid economic stimulus, the strategist wrote.

I know here you get a lot of spams, and rarely credible content. Every body talks about good at trading but who has the balls to predict ahead of time, their trades and declare their trades in advance, and achieve the target goal declared before the trading? This can only be done by someone who knows. Who has the secret formula. I have it. Daily on my youtube channel I post a video, in which I pick 3-5 stocks to be traded next day. On Jan 1 2020 I posted a video on my channel declaring that I will achieve 50% profit this year. So far I am 55% up this year. All my trades are transparent. Everyday in my daily videos I review my profit for the year 2020 and pick new stocks for trading for the next day. You can follow it yourself, and it is free.

Watch this! ‚ÄúNew research published in the European Journal of Pain is offering some of the first clinical trial insights into the efficacy of microdosing THC to treat chronic pain. The results of the small trial suggest minute doses of THC may confer clinically apparent reductions in pain sensation without inducing psychoactive side effects.

A microdose is generally known as a subtherapeutic dose of a drug, and the term has more recently become synonymous with tiny, regular dosing of psychedelics such as LSD. The practice has been anecdotally popular, however, little research has been conducted to rigorously test how useful these imperceptible doses of psychedelic drugs actually can be.‚Äù

They are forcing their nationals in the West to go back to China with threats of &#39;suicide&#39;. The FBI Director just mentioned this yesterday.

That trade negotiator Liu He who&#39;s been flying back and forth for Phase 1 talks has announced for China to prepare for an internally-circulated economy.  

This should happen after they invaded Taiwan. They appear very confident that they can  hold onto Taiwan and keep America away,  just like the Imperial Japanese in 1942. 

The CCP has also announced today the extinguishing of national medical coverage, leaving it to the people to pay for their own medicine.  And this is a socialist state! It clearly is part of a plan to retain as much funds in the hands of the CCP as possible for what is to come.

&quot;Fed Is Getting Awfully Close to Backing Apple Stock&quot;

(Apple is ONLY going up) The bonds the fed bought will allow apple to buy MORE of their STOCK BACK.

Apple has the second-highest investment-grade credit ratings from Moody‚Äôs Investors Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings, allowing it to issue $2.5 billion of 30-year bonds in May that yielded just 2.72%. Its $2 billion of three-year debt, within the Fed‚Äôs maturity range, priced to yield less than 0.85%.

Still, Apple openly using debt sales to help finance share repurchases puts the Fed in a somewhat awkward position. Chair Jerome Powell has consistently framed questions about its secondary-market facility in the context of supporting the central bank‚Äôs full employment mandate. Workers are ‚Äúthe intended beneficiaries of all of our programs,‚Äù he said in a hearing last month. It‚Äôs possible Americans ‚Äúare able to keep their jobs because companies can finance themselves.‚Äù

AAPL,"$SPY $UVXY $BA $TSLA $AAPL My thoughts on today... this morning in pre-mkt I was shorting BA and I warned investors that it&#39;s going lower, as is other travel/leisure companies (was short RCL as well). And as I pointed out yesterday, the Nasdaq is getting very close to a blowoff top. So why the bearish calls today? Two reasons 1) anyone see the VIX yesterday. Up on a big up mkt day. That signals positioning into protection. 2) more importantly, many of you probably remember talking a lot about bond yields. Anyone notice them today? I follow the 10 yr and as I noted last week, a break below .60 and I think this mkt gets spooked. We are getting dangerously close at .63. On a more technical level, the mkt tried to retest that 3220 level. And although we are going to be choppy, use today&#39;s mkt highs as your tradable top. For me, I continue to find weak companies like BA and RCL to short on pops. Yes, im still skeptical of this mkt. But I will climb along for any ride if we break 3220 ‚úå‚úå",2020-07-07T20:12:53Z,162218,225959486

Disney Looking good.  The key to making money in this market is following the smart money.  The smart money for sure will be in Disney on Thursday and Friday, no doubt about it.  The question is what about rest of today and tomorrow.  Still think it is risky b/c who knows, maybe market down bigly tonight and Disney may pullback tomorrow (like it did last night/this morning). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I&#39;m liking what i&#39;m seeing though on the charts - Disney MACD coiling back up, RSI indicating not overbought.  Also, there&#39;s only so much money to shift around, no one is jumping in.  Predicting that the Apple money, the microsoft money, the facebook money, the Chase money is now selling off/going to shift into Disney by end of week.

Make no mistake the House of the Mouse will be the stock of Thursday and Friday.  How can it not after Disney has consolidated and hasn&#39;t had it&#39;s run up yet?  GL.",2020-07-07T17:30:06Z,1420408,225901973

Apple price target raised despite forecast concern.

Jul. 07, 2020 10:07 AM ETApple Inc. (AAPL)By: Brandy Betz, SA News Editor19 Comments.

Ahead of the fall&#39;s 5G iPhone launch, Raymond James raises Apple&#39;s (NASDAQ:AAPL) price target from $340 to $400 and maintains an Outperform rating.

The firm says that investors will look to 2021 for the tech giant&#39;s normalized earnings power since that will be after the pandemic&#39;s impact and a full year of the 5G products.

Raymond James does see potential risks to the upcoming Q4 guidance due to the pandemic.

Apple is expected to report fiscal Q3 earnings on July 29. Consensus estimates see $51.81B in revenue and $2.03 EPS.

Apple shares are up 0.5% to $375.76.

The most important driver in this melt-up is liquidity.

Let&#39;s talk about that.  Simply put what is an easy explanation of liquidity?

The treasury issues bonds (loans $) to companies (apple, ford, energy companies, etc)

These companies pay their bills with that cheap $ from the treasury.

Instead of the company paying that loan back:
The FED then takes that debt &#39;temporarily&#39; off the company&#39;s books and puts the debt on the FED&#39;s balance sheet.

Since late March, the FED has been buying MORE debt than the US treasury has been issuing.

HOWEVER, since early June...the FED&#39;s balance sheet has been slowly shrinking.  That&#39;s net NEGATIVE liquidity....after record levels of net positive liquidity.

Simply put, the FED is NO LONGER covering the 200 billion/wk that the treasury is issuing.  Now, companies have to start making those debt payments.  

Simply put, unless the fed reverses course and adds another 2 or 3 trillion to the sheet, there&#39;s gonna be mass insolvency.",2020-07-06T15:49:05Z,3463852,225573169

Corporations raise $1 Trillion in the BOND MARKET amid FED BACKSTOP, DOUBLE the pace of last year &amp; WHY? 

Only reason that the fed is doing this is do to the fact that corporations had too much DEBT relative to their INCOME &amp; CASH on their balance sheet going into the covid-19 event. Apple prime example has $94 Billion in &quot;cash&quot; &amp; $119  Billion in DEBT w/ revenue @ $268 Billion

Apple iPhone sales slowing , no body needs another phone . Stock will crash down to reality , iPhones make up 50% of revenue , this year will be worst year for iPhones .

AAPL,"After almost 10 years of following and investing in the market, my overwhelming conclusion is: most or all of these bashers and scammers who speak negatively (and don‚Äôt issue a disclaimer that they‚Äôre only giving short term opinions) are really just trying to rob you of your confidence and prevent you - if they can - from buying and holding excellent businesses for the long term.  That‚Äôs the whole game, in my opinion.  It‚Äôs that simple.

AAPL,"$SPY $DJIA $AAPL $BA 

As of writing this, SPY at 310.28. 30 more minutes to go (11:30 AM EST) for a drastic change in the market direction.

First of all, the sell-off cycle has one more week left to go. July 8, 9, 10 are the dates I expect to have lot of action. My forecast for cycle lows 2.8K SPY and 23.5 DJIA ( June 18-June 24) looks like it could have been pushed to July 8,9,10. If that&#39;s not happening I lost. FAILED. NOBODY can beat MARKET! No Genius has born to predict that. PERIOD.

Second, I have been adding PUTS Sep 18 for BA, AAPL, BYND. But I plan to refresh sell/open next week based on July 8,9,10 when market expect to go higher for another 2 weeks post July 11th.

Third, Around end of July, 2020 a news such as &quot;most important&quot; person&#39;s health condition etc could bring added uncertainty to market. Aug 15th onward the tides are back and lows will start flowing again.

You are welcome, in advance for your comments and trolls!

i have big trades for long dated SPY puts anticipating a retrace in Aug and Sep. But the Pfizer news today is fucking amazing folks...

The first vaccine where the patient develops the antibodies to combat covid is revolutionary to the vaccine race. The most deadly thing about the virus was the host being exposed to it, symptoms dissipating, and then being exposed to a more deadly mutated virus without having developed antibodies initially... the preliminary vaccine trials have demonstrated scenarios where the host develops the antibodies to combat the virus and is about to go through a massive human trial!

And for this news to come out ahead of the 4th of July??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Have you ever seen anything more fucking PATRIOTIC?!?!

AAPL,"$SPY $BA $UVXY $AAPL $TSLA My thoughts this morning  ... yesterday, when mkts were surging I recommended you start to build short positions (SEE BELOW). The reason? The mkt was at the top end of my trading range of 3100, a level I think holds. Also,  the news just keep ls getting worse. And in typical fashion, the mkt pumped into qtr end and once again trapped a lot of bulls. Now, we have some economic data coming up next two days. But im expecting bad news not good. The key today is two things- 1) does the mkt make an inside/outside move. Meaning, do we take out yesterday&#39;s entire gains and close on the lows. Secondly, and more importantly, watch the growth stocks. SHOP, ZM, FSLY, TWLO, AAPL, etc. Why? If those go against their daily pattern - uo when mkt sells off, reversing this &quot;pour money into the high growth/stay at home stocks&quot;, well, you can pencil in 2950 retest and all of a sudden 2800 will start being discussed.

When we were kids moms put all their kids together for a sleep over. When one of the kids in the neighborhood got the measles.
Every kid was eventually going to get the measles , the logic was get the Epidemic of Measles over quickly.

ThIs Main reason why I do not wear a mask .
I think I probably already had COVID-19.
 I got a stye in my eye, 

If your well enough to go to get a COVID-19 test and stand in line for hours to get tested.
YOUR NOT GOING TO DIE FROM COVID-19 

 I have traveled the world. Been exposed to quite a few germs in my time
 I caught H1N1 2009, Thanks Obama you did not do your job in 2009
 (cause COVID-19 is Trumps fault right lefties)
 The main reason why the Aztecs, Mayans ,American Indians suffered from and Died from European diseases when the Europeans came to the americas.
  They did not have any antibodies to fight the diseases.
 Because they were NEVER Exposed to any of the European flu , smallpox , etc etc.

AAPL,"$SPY $UVXY $AAPL $TSLA $BA My thoughts on today  ... news just keeps getting worse. However, the mkt jumped and late day caught wind of  huge buy on mkt close orders which brought us right to the level I said would be our resistance - 3100. Earlier in the day I mentioned you will probably want to start building short positions above 307, preferably if we pump over 308. I did so because I thought the end of day pump had already occurred - I didn&#39;t see that 20 handle move coming. Regardless, now what? Well, I stick to my sell thesis up at this level until we can close above 3100. Anyone see bond yields? I&#39;m watching that 10yr like a hawk. If it cracks .60 we are heading to 2800. Gold? If everything is all clear, why is gold trading at 8 yr highs? Yeah, history says the next two days are very bullish heading into the 4th of July weekend. However, history never include Covid-19.

‚ÄúWe are trying to figure it out, and trying to find a bank that is working with the government on this,‚Äù Haith said. ‚ÄúThe guidance is pretty convoluted, and the banks seem a little wary.‚Äù

This is by design but notice the 793 &quot;Individual Corporate Bonds&quot; that purchased no problem w/ taxpayer dollars.

When banks stop lending like this it creates problems fast.

#1 Apple is a great company with huge buy backs.

Reasons to sell apple.
#1 Apple is trading at historically high valuations in a HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MARKET.
#2 the rising wedge pattern indicates Apple has reached the too of its run and is WAY overdue for pullback.
#3 the harmonic bearish crab pattern which is 85-90% accurate says Apple will drop to a minimum of $290.

And if things deteriorated further, 2800 was not out of the question. This morning we touched 2980 and the mkt deemed that worthy enough to bounce. I sensed this would probably occur, hence my recommendation of buying FB in pre-mkt at $207 (SEE BELOW) for a trade today. So where does that leave us? BA really dragged this mkt higher, as well as dragging the beaten up sectors like airlines, casinos and cruise ships. But I&#39;m not buying that BA bounce. Don&#39;t get me wrong, BA closed strong. But who is going to buy these new planes if certification goes as they plan. Id be more of a seller of BA after that huge runup. And as I&#39;ve stated all last week, 3100 to me is sort of the ceiling on this overall trading range.

Apple  (AAPL) -  stock continued its gains into Monday, with shares up 1.9% to $360.49.

2/2

A- knowing the tickers that will make me some daily money- pharma/bio-&gt; vaccines play, testings etc. These tickers (posted next) will drive the volume and be hot for daily swings. This is where we keep &quot;tight stops&quot;
B-keeping my long term &quot;investments&quot; separate from daily &quot;trading&quot; stocks. This where we all get confused and end up losing money. Say, for eg, I am in Reits, I wont close any trade seeing some deficit cuz that is not my daily swing play but a long term play. But again, this is where I said 2-3 weeks ago to dont forget to &quot;take some profits&quot; on the go as now I can buy more shares at a cheap price and further build my long term portfolio. This is where I will &quot;not&quot; generally put any stops.

US bill aiming to delist Chinese companies could claim American investors, businesses as unintended victims

If it becomes law, Chinese companies will be required to comply with the rules or face being delisted, which would put US$1.3 trillion of US-listed Chinese firms, including behemoths Alibaba Group and Tencent, at risk of losing access to the world‚Äôs largest capital markets.

The bill passed the US Senate by unanimous consent on May 20 and awaits a vote in the House of Representatives. Under the bill, failure to provide information for three straight years would lead to trading bans of the shares.

Miami-Dade County beaches ordered closed for July 4th weekend

The mayor says the decision comes after speaking to the county&#39;s public health experts.

&quot;As we continue to see more COVID-19 positive test results among young adults and rising hospitalizations, I have decided that the only prudent thing to do to tamp down this recent uptick is to crack down on recreational activities that put our overall community at higher risk,&quot; the mayor said in a statement. &quot;I have been seeing too many businesses and people ignoring these lifesaving rules. If people are not going to be responsible and protect themselves and others from this pandemic, then the government is forced to step in and restore common sense to save lives.&quot;

Expect More Of This To Come. Sun Belt Will Be Hit Hard.

He believes heavily that fundamentals drive market direction and puts little to no faith in option and volatility sentiment. Back in May I started observing some weird shifts in option positioning pointing with an expectation that markets would decline end of June and well into July. The activity seemed normal at face value, but upon identifying that retail traders were moving the ticker in the call buying department as institutionals loaded up speculative put plays while at the same time keeping volatility under control, i was alarmed. I immediately told my friends and family to sell 20-40% of their LT equity positions. Tried to also help my friend but he said it was stupid that euphoria masked by retail buying was a bad thing.

I also pointed to the end of qtr rebalancing and how professionals will try to get out in front of it because there may be some big selling. My call was for a test of 2950 but they sure did defend 3,000 and held the 200 day.  Congrats if you took advantage. So now what? Well, everything I use to determine direction tells me not only is 2950 in play, but 2800 is also a possibility. And I am short heading into Monday. So why am I still weary? Because it almost looks too obvious. And I KNOW some serious jawboning, vaccine news, trade deal progress, etc. will hit Sunday night if we are deep red.

The mkt looks exhausted. And now the banks just got calped. We can&#39;t make new highs without financials. So, stay nimble. I&#39;m more inclined to short pops.

AAPL,$AAPL do you remember less than two years ago when Apple was crucified because they didn‚Äôt report iPhone sales? They were getting pissed at all the analysts that only focused on that one segment of their industry. They were explaining that they were evolving into much bigger things. But the analysts couldn‚Äôt handle it. They couldn‚Äôt figure out how to model a projection on Apple outside just phone sales. (Enter in the stupidity of the analyst). I wish I had recording UNH on CNBC saying sell. They won‚Äôt give us numbers. They were the smartest people on the street to handle Wall Street.

AAPL,"$SPY $UVXY $BA $AAPL My thoughts on today... oh what a difference a day makes. More bad news, different results. But hey, you can&#39;t deny the rally into the close. Even the crap tried to rally - casinos, airlines and cruise ships. Albeit after several painful days. The mkt has left us in a pretty tight trading range and it&#39;s clear until it breaks (2950-3200). What breaks it to thd downside? All the things I&#39;ve already listed can and should make the mkt break. What breaks it to the upside? A vaccine. Yes, I think we are absolutely capped at that 3200 top until a vaccine or some extremely positive news on Covid-19. And that&#39;s why I lean more pessimistic when we are at that 3100 level because our ceiling is somewhat capped imo. So now what? The way the mkt closed on such a big rally would leave you to bet the mkt gaps up tomorrow. But I&#39;m not going to bite. For one, I think there are too many red flags. But also, I still see further downside. I&#39;m more inclined to own a little UVXY. Gutsy.",2020-06-25T22:54:37Z,162218,223031915
