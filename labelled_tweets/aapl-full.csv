Additionally dollar swap lines don’t add USD to the system either. They simply add USD funding to the system. Those two are very different outcomes.

Since then, the stock is up 43%. Yet, he didn’t entirely miss out on the rally. Meeks still owns shares in his clients’ portfolios as an underweight because he knows he’s being judged versus the tech benchmarks. Plus, he still views Apple as an “iconic” company.

In the third quarter, Apple garnered 51.3% of the country’s market share for smartphones priced at more than $500. In the second quarter, the company’s market share in the premium segment was 41.2%, meaning that India’s preference for iPhones is growing at a phenomenal pace. Promotional offers and price reductions on the iPhone XR, iPhone 8, and iPhone 7 are some of the factors contributing to this, according to the IDC.
